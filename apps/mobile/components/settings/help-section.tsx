/**
 * Where the first-run tour goes to live afterwards.
 *
 * Onboarding used to be genuinely once-only: it ran before the first sign-in,
 * set a flag, and became unreachable for the life of the install. That is the
 * wrong shape for it — the slides explain what the app is *for*, which is worth
 * more to somebody three weeks in and unsure what "board exam mode" does than
 * to somebody who has not signed up yet and is skipping to get past it.
 *
 * So it stays out of the way and stays reachable.
