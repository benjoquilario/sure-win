/**
 * ─── The brand marks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every one of these artworks sits in a **square canvas with its ink floating
 * in the middle**, and the amount of empty space differs wildly between them:
 * the wordmark's type occupies 47px of a 192px canvas — 24% of the height —
 * while the mark takes 64% and the lockup 63%.
 *
 * That is why `contentFit="contain"` cannot be used directly. Contain fits the
 * whole *canvas* into the box, so asking for a 20pt-tall wordmark renders the
 * canvas at 20×20 and the type inside it at 5pt: a blue smudge. Which is
 * exactly what shipped, and exactly what this file now exists to prevent.
 *
 * So each artwork declares the rectangle its ink actually occupies, measured
 * off the file rather than eyeballed, and `InkImage` maps that rectangle onto
 * the requested box. Sizes below are therefore **the height of the visible
 * ink**, which is the only number a layout cares about.
