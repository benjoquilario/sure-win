/**
 * ─── Announcements ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Updates tab, backed by the database at last.
 *
 * It used to render `data/news-data.ts` — six items hardcoded in TypeScript,
 * with date labels reading "Today" and "Mar 19, 2026" that could only ever
 * change in an app release. Meanwhile `announcements` sat in the schema,
 * readable, with an `audience` enum that already modelled exactly the right
 * targets, and not one line of app code touched it.
 *
 * **`audience` is a targeting hint, not a secret.** The table is `app_readonly`,
 * so every member can read every row whatever its audience — a free member can
 * read the premium announcement if they go looking. The filtering below is
 * about relevance, never privacy, and the backend writes announcements on that
 * understanding (section 19, item 9).
