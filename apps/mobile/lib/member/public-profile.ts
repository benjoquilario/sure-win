/**
 * ─── The part of a member other members can see ───────────────────────────
 *
 * New in v4, and the reason it exists is worth stating plainly.
 *
 * `user_profiles` used to be `member_public`, because the forum has to render
 * an author's name. It also carries `email`, `licenseNumber`,
 * `schoolOrEmployer` and `schoolName`. So every signed-in account could read
 * every other member's email address and PRC licence number, in bulk, with one
 * call. Nothing in the app offered it. Nothing had to — the table's access
 * model *is* the privacy, and no amount of the app declining to render a field
 * makes it private.
 *
 * So identity split in two. `user_profiles` went `member_private` and keeps
 * everything real; this table holds the three things a stranger may see.
 *
 * **Adding a column here publishes it to every member of the app.** The
 * question before adding one is not "would a screen show this" but "would we be
 * comfortable with a competitor exporting this column for the whole
 * membership", because that is what the column means. Specifically not here:
 * an email address, a licence number, and anything about payment or membership
 * state — a premium badge on a post is a list of who to phish.
