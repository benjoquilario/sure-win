 * belongs to the app.
 *
 * `user_roles.role` is a **dashboard job** — encoder, moderator, admin. The app
 * never reads it, never branches on it, and never unlocks anything with it. An
 * admin who opens this app gets exactly the screens anyone else gets, with
 * exactly the same paywall.
 *
 * `user_profiles.memberType` is **who somebody is** — a student, a graduate
 * sitting the board, a retaker, a licensed social worker doing CPD. It is ours,
 * it is optional, and it grants nothing. It shapes copy and announcement
 * targeting, never access.
 *
 * Premium is the only thing that gates a screen, and it comes from
 * `isPremium` / `premiumUntil` — see `./membership`.
