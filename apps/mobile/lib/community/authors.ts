/**
 * ─── Who wrote this ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * New in v4, and it replaces something that was quietly broken.
 *
 * The feed used to build an empty `profileMap` and then read `authorName`,
 * `authorSubtitle` and `authorAvatarUrl` off the post row — columns that have
 * never existed in the schema. Both halves resolved to nothing, so every byline
 * in the community rendered as `User 68a3f2` / "Community member". Nobody
 * noticed because it never threw.
 *
 * v4 gives it a real answer, and a private one. `user_profiles` went
 * `member_private`, because it carries an email address, a PRC licence number
 * and an employer, and being `member_public` meant every signed-in account
 * could read all three for the whole membership in one call. What other members
 * are allowed to see now lives in `user_public_profiles`, and that is the only
 * table this module touches (section 20).
 *
 * **Adding a column to that table publishes it to every member of the app.**
 * There is no halfway. This module deliberately reads three fields and asks for
 * nothing else.
