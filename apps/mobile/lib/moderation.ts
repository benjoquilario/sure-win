/**
 * ─── Reporting ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The one thing the app may do with `flagged_content`.
 *
 * The table is `member_submit`: **create only, with no read at all** and row
 * security switched off. That shape is deliberate — a member must not be able
 * to see what has been reported, including their own reports, because a
 * readable moderation queue tells a bad actor exactly which of their posts got
 * through.
 *
 * Three consequences fall straight out of it:
 *
 *   • The create carries **no permissions**. Appwrite rejects a create that
 *     sends them to a table with row security off, so `createRow` drops them —
 *     `tableNeedsRowPermissions("flagged_content")` is false.
 *   • The app cannot check whether a report already exists before filing one.
 *   • So the unique index on `(reportedBy, contentType, contentId)` is the only
 *     channel that can tell it. A 409 means *already reported*, and the honest
 *     thing to show for that is the same thank-you as a first report — see
 *     gotcha 10.
 *
 * New in v3: `question` and `material` joined the community content types.
 * That is a small change with a large consequence. A reviewer app's whole
 * credibility is its answer key, and until now a member who found a wrong one
 * had nowhere to put it — so it went to a Facebook group, or a one-star review,
 * or nowhere, while the item stayed wrong for everybody who reached it next.
