/**
 * ─── Release signing that survives `expo prebuild` ────────────────────────
 *
 * The Expo template ships this:
 *
 *   release {
 *       // Caution! In production, you need to generate your own keystore file.
 *       signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
 *   }
 *
 * A release build therefore comes out signed with `debug.keystore` — the one
 * every React Native project ships, password `android`. It installs fine, which
 * is exactly what makes it dangerous: nothing fails until Play rejects the
 * upload with "You uploaded an APK signed with a debug certificate."
 *
 * Editing `android/app/build.gradle` by hand fixes it until the next
 * `expo prebuild`, which regenerates the file from the template and silently
 * puts the debug key back. That is a bug that reappears months later, on the
 * one build you did not check. Hence a plugin: prebuild re-applies it every
 * time.
 *
 * **No secrets live here.** The keystore path and both passwords are read from
 * Gradle properties, which are set in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on the
 * machine that signs. This file is safe to commit; that one is not, and is
 * outside the repo precisely so it cannot be.
 *
 * When those properties are absent — a fresh clone, CI, a teammate — the build
 * falls back to the debug key and still works. It just cannot be published,
 * which is the correct outcome for a machine holding no signing key.
