 *   client. The CMS-authored content tables.
 * - `member_private` a member creates rows and sees only their own. Row
 *   security carries the ownership; the table grants nothing but `create`.
 * - `member_public`  same, but every member reads every row: the profile
 *   behind a forum post has to be readable by whoever is reading the post.
 * - `member_shared`  `member_public` plus table-level `update`, for the
 *   denormalised counters one member increments on another member's row.
