# Google Play Billing — v2 (backend handoff)

**For:** the dashboard / CMS backend
**From:** the mobile app
**Against:** `MOBILE-SCHEMA-NOTES-v6.md`

Supersedes `google-play-billing.md`, which was written against v4 and before the
billing audit. Everything here is checked against the v6 `schema.ts` and against
the live database, not inferred from either.

**The short version:** no schema work is left. Two Appwrite Functions and a set of
plan rows stand between the app and taking money.

## 1. What changed since v1

The v5 audit found and fixed things v1 did not know about. Three matter to this
handoff:

- **`subscriptions.purchaseToken` had no index.** It is the column both server
  handlers look rows up by, and the only identifier a renewal notification
  carries. Without it the first real purchase would have failed *after the
  member paid*. `idx_subscription_token` now exists and is **unique**, so
  replaying a purchase updates one row instead of granting two — but it is on
  `purchaseTokenHash`, not on the token, and §3 explains why that is not a
  detail you can skip.
- **Payment-failure states are real now.** Google does not cancel on a declined
  card — it retries for up to 30 days. Three new statuses cover it.
- **`billing_notifications` exists.** Every message Google sends is recorded, which
  is what makes a redelivered notification a no-op.

The mobile app has already been updated for all of this. Nothing below is
blocked on us.

## 2. Who owns what

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Play Console products, prices, base plans | **Backend / whoever holds the Play account** |
| Service account, API access, Pub/Sub topic | **Backend** |
| The two Functions below | **Backend** |
| Authoring plan rows | **Backend / dashboard** |
| Play Billing client, checkout UI, membership copy | Mobile |
| Entitlement checks | Mobile — already done, no changes coming |

---

## 3. Tables — nothing to create

All five billing tables exist with their columns and indexes in place, confirmed
against the live database.

| Table | Access model | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `subscription_plans` | `app_readonly` | What can be bought |
| `subscriptions` | `server_private` | One purchased period — the source of truth |
| `payments` | `server_only` | One row per charge |
| `access_codes` | `server_only` | Redeemable codes |
| `billing_notifications` | `server_only` | Every message Google sent |

### `subscriptions` columns

```
userId  planId  planName  status  startsAt  endsAt  autoRenew  source
amountPaid  currency  accessCodeId
purchaseToken  purchaseTokenHash  linkedPurchaseToken  linkedPurchaseTokenHash
orderId  productId  basePlanId  offerId
obfuscatedAccountId  autoRenewing  isAcknowledged  acknowledgedAt
latestNotificationType  latestNotificationAt  cancelledAt  note  createdAt
```

### Look purchases up by the hash, not the token

**This is the one thing in this document that will bite you if you skip it.**

Appwrite refuses to index a string column longer than **767** characters, and a
Play purchase token needs **1024** to be stored without truncation. So the column
that holds the token and the column that finds it are different columns:

```ts
// WRONG — no index behind it, and there cannot be one
Query.equal('purchaseToken', [token])

// RIGHT
Query.equal('purchaseTokenHash', [sha256Hex(token)])
```

`purchaseTokenHash` is the lowercase hex SHA-256 of the token. `hashPurchaseToken()`
is exported from `lib/appwrite/subscriptions.ts`, and the handlers already use it
— this matters to you only if you query these tables yourself.

**Write both columns together.** A row with a token and no fingerprint is
invisible to every lookup in the system, which is the same outcome as not writing
the row at all.

The token is still stored in full. Verifying and acknowledging a purchase needs
the real value, so nothing is truncated and the hash is not a security measure.

`payments` and `billing_notifications` carry `purchaseTokenHash` for the same
reason.

### `subscriptions` indexes

| Index | Type | Columns | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `idx_subscription_token` | **unique** | `purchaseTokenHash` | Renewal lookups; uniqueness makes replay safe |
| `idx_subscription_order` | key | `orderId` | Finding a row from a notification that names an order |
| `idx_subscription_linked_token` | key | `linkedPurchaseTokenHash` | Finding the subscription an upgrade replaced |
| `idx_subscription_acknowledged` | key | `status`, `isAcknowledged` | **The refund alarm** — see §9 |
| `idx_subscription_user_status` | key | `userId`, `status` | The member's own row |
| `idx_subscription_expiry` | key | `status`, `endsAt` | The nightly expiry sweep |

One row per *charge* is `idx_payment_order`, unique on `payments.orderId` — not
this table's `idx_subscription_order`, which is an ordinary key index.

**Nobody needs to create or alter a table**, but the migration does have to be
run: `pnpm appwrite:bootstrap --confirm`. As of this document it has been, and
every index above is confirmed present and available in the live database.

---

## 4. Rows — author the plans

`subscription_plans` has **zero rows**, verified against the live database. The
premium screen renders whatever is in this table, so a finished checkout would
still have nothing to sell.

Order matters: the Play Console product must exist first, because
`googleProductId` has to point at something real.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ | Card title, e.g. "Premium Monthly" |
| `googleProductId` | ✅ | **Exact** Play Console product ID. Uniquely indexed |
| `price` | ✅ | Whole pesos — `299` = ₱299. A placeholder; Play's price is charged |
| `durationDays` | ✅ | `30` monthly, `365` yearly |
| `currency` | | Default `PHP` |
| `isRecurring` | | Default `true` |
| `features` | | String list, rendered as bullets |
| `order` | | Default `1`. Card order |
| `isPopular` | | Default `false`. Badges one card |
| `isActive` | | Default `true`. Retires a plan; existing subscribers keep working |
| `code`, `description` | | Optional |
| `subscriberCount` | | Server-maintained — do not set by hand |

`googleBasePlanId` is optional and only useful once a product has more than one
base plan.

---

## 5. Function 1 — purchase verification

Wraps `applyGooglePurchase()`, which is already written. This is the wrapper, not
the logic.

### Contract

```
POST  (Appwrite Function execution, authenticated)

in    { purchaseToken, productId, orderId }
out   { ok: true, subscription }
      { ok: false, message }

userId  from the JWT — never from the body
```

### It must

1. **Verify** the token against `purchases.subscriptionsv2.get`. A token posted by
   a client is a claim, not a fact — anyone can post one.
2. **Check `obfuscatedExternalAccountId`** from Play's response against the JWT's
   user. Store it in `subscriptions.obfuscatedAccountId`. This is what stops one
   member's purchase being redeemed on another account.
3. **Acknowledge** the purchase with Google before returning.
4. Write `subscriptions` and `payments`, and re-sync the cached fields on
   `user_profiles`.
5. Persist `basePlanId`, `offerId`, and `linkedPurchaseToken` when
   `subscriptionsv2.get` returns them — the columns are there.

### Acknowledge is a deadline

**Google automatically refunds any purchase not acknowledged within three days.**
`isAcknowledged` and `acknowledgedAt` record that it happened.

### Then

Give us the Function ID. The app will read it as
`EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PURCHASE_VERIFY_FUNCTION_ID`, registered in
`lib/appwrite.ts` beside the three that already exist.

---

## 6. Function 2 — the RTDN webhook

Wraps `applyGoogleNotification()`, also already written. A plain HTTP endpoint
Google's Pub/Sub push subscription can POST to. Must be publicly reachable.

### Notification types to handle

| Type | Meaning | Effect | Access? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `2` RENEWED | Charged again | `endsAt` extended, renewal recorded | Yes |
| `3` CANCELED | Auto-renew off | Nothing ends — runs to `endsAt` | **Yes** |
| `5` ON_HOLD | Card failed, Play gave up | `status: on_hold` | No |
| `6` IN_GRACE_PERIOD | Card failed, Play retrying | `status: in_grace_period` | **Yes** |
| `10` PAUSED | Member paused it | `status: paused` | No |
| `12` REVOKED | Refunded / charged back | `status: refunded`, charges marked refunded | No |
| `13` EXPIRED | Period ended | `status: expired` | No |

Two of these are counter-intuitive and both cost money if got wrong:

> **CANCELED does not end access.** The member paid for the period and keeps it
> until `endsAt`. Cutting them off early is taking back something already sold.
>
> **IN_GRACE_PERIOD does not end access either.** Their card was declined and
> Google is still retrying. They have not cancelled and have done nothing wrong.

### Idempotency

Pub/Sub is **at-least-once** — redelivery is normal, not an error. Record each
message in `billing_notifications` keyed on `messageId` and make a repeat a no-op.
The unique `idx_subscription_token` is the second line of defence.

`claimPlayNotification()` and `finishPlayNotification()` do this already: claim
before touching a subscription, finish after. A claim that returns
`{ claimed: false }` has already been handled — return 200 and stop, or Pub/Sub
will keep retrying a message you did apply.

### Upgrades

When a member changes plan, Play issues a new token carrying
`linkedPurchaseToken` pointing at the old one. Close the replaced subscription
rather than leaving two active rows — `idx_subscription_linked_token` is there
for that lookup.

## 7. Credentials the backend needs

None of these go anywhere near the app. If a credential would let a client mark
itself premium, it is in the wrong place.

| Credential | Where from | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Service account JSON** | Google Cloud → IAM → Service Accounts | Store as a Function environment variable. A bearer credential for your revenue |
| **Service account email** | Same | `name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. Grant it permissions in Play Console |
| **Cloud project** | Play Console → Setup → API access | Link it, then enable the *Google Play Android Developer API* |
| **Play Console permissions** | Play Console → Users and permissions | *View financial data* **and** *Manage orders and subscriptions*. Can take **24 h** to take effect |
| **Pub/Sub topic** | Google Cloud → Pub/Sub | `projects/<project>/topics/<topic>`, entered in Monetization setup. Grant Google's publisher account rights to publish to it |
| **Push subscription** | Google Cloud → Pub/Sub | Points at the Function 2 URL |
| **Merchant account** | Play Console | Bank details and tax info. Required to actually be paid |

### Not needed

- **The licensing key** (base64 RSA in Monetization setup) — that is for on-device
  signature checks. Server-side verification supersedes it and is stronger.
- **Any payment provider** — no Stripe, PayPal, or GCash. Digital goods consumed
  in the app must go through Play Billing.
- **RevenueCat or similar** — they exist to build what `applyGooglePurchase()` and
  `applyGoogleNotification()` already do.

---

## 8. What the app already does

So the backend knows what it can rely on.

- Reads plans from `subscription_plans` with `isActive` / `order`, and renders
  Play's formatted price over the stored one.
- Gates **everything** on `hasActivePremium(profile)`, which checks
  `premiumUntil` as well as `isPremium`. Never on `subscriptions.status`.
- Reads `subscriptions` for one screen only — Manage membership.
- Handles all eight statuses in the membership copy, including the three new
  ones, with a neutral fallback for any status Play adds later.
- Never writes `subscriptions`, `payments`, `user_profiles.isPremium`,
  `premiumUntil`, `planName`, or `subscriptionStatus`.
- Does not read `billing_notifications`.

**Still to do on our side**, once the products exist: add the Play Billing client,
replace the stubbed checkout button, and pass Play's obfuscated account identifier
when launching the flow.

---

## 9. How we know it works

### The alarm worth having on day one

`idx_subscription_acknowledged` exists precisely for this query:

```
status = 'active' AND isAcknowledged = false
```

Any row it returns is **money on its way back to the customer**. It should always
be empty. This is the single most useful check on the whole system and it costs
one indexed query.

### Test matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| First purchase | `subscriptions` row, `payments` row, `isAcknowledged` true, profile re-synced |
| Any row with a `purchaseToken` | `purchaseTokenHash` is set on it. A blank one is a row no lookup can find |
| Same notification delivered twice | Second is a no-op; one row, one charge |
| Renewal | `endsAt` extended, a second `payments` row |
| Cancel | `autoRenewing` false, **access continues** to `endsAt` |
| Card declined | `status: in_grace_period`, **access continues** |
| Retries exhausted | `status: on_hold`, access ends |
| Refund | `status: refunded`, charges marked refunded, access ends |
| Plan upgrade | Old subscription closed via `linkedPurchaseToken`, not left active |
| Token replayed from another account | Rejected — `obfuscatedAccountId` does not match the JWT |

---

## 10. Also on the queue

Open items from `BACKEND-REQUESTS.md`, tracked in §19 of the v5 notes:

| # | Ask | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Password recovery — SMTP + redirect URL | Console configuration; no code substitutes for it |
| 3 | Premium question access Function | **Pair this with billing.** `questions` stays `app_readonly` until it exists, so any signed-in member can read the entire paid bank — prompt, choices, `answerIndex`, explanation. A paywall over already-readable content protects revenue on paper only |
| 7 | Access code redemption Function | `redeemAccessCode()` is written; only the wrapper is missing |

---

## Critical path

1. **Play Console products** — nothing downstream can start without them.
2. **Plan rows** in the dashboard, pointing at those product IDs.
3. **Function 1**, so a purchase can be verified and acknowledged.
4. **Function 2 + Pub/Sub**, so renewals and refunds land.

Steps 3 and 4 wrap logic that already exists. This is wiring, not a build.
